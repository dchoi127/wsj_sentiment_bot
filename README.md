Hello! This is my webscraping project that I created because I was interested in seeing how WSJ influenced trading! `Webscraping.ipynb` is the scraping notebook that visits WSJ's archive
and starts scraping text. The other notebook is still a work in progress that uses a pretrained sentiment analysis model called Finbert to extract the sentiment of each article. The next
steps would be to create a trading bot that uses the sentiment of the articles to trade.
